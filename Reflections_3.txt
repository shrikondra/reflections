When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	- If I wish to build something based on someone else's Github codebase, I am able to "fork" the original repository to my Github account. Then develop from there.
	  (Rather than downloading someone else's Github repository, onto my local PC desktop, followed by uploading to my Github account.)
	- Having a remote repository enable ease of remote collaboration with other programmers.
	- It also enables ease of project sharing to the public.
	- It also acts as a form of "backup". e.g. if the home PC desktop blows up, it's good to know there is a backup repository in the cloud (GitHub).


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	- not quite sure... (yet!)


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	- branch: node A of local repository branch out to node B and C of same local repository
	- clone: clone lcoal repository A from one local location to another local location.
	- clone: cline Github repository A from one Github location to another local location.  (and vice versa)
	- fork: clone Github repository A from one Github location to another Github location.  (and vice versa)


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	- provide an opportunity to merge the remote reposit with the local reposit and keep up-to-date.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	- To collaborate without using Git / GitHub, each person will need to agree who work on what so there is no overlap.
	- If overlap is expected, will need to make sure each person have had a copy of the entire code base so there is no interference between individuals.
	- Whenever someone is ready to make an update, that someone will need to manually coordinate with the rest and find out whether it's ok to promote to production.
	- This is ok for small projects. For large project, a more sophisicated version control system may make the developmenet life cycle more consistent.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	- branch is especially good for experimeneting something risky without impacting the original master.
	- only when the user is fairly satisfied with the branch version, the user may then decide whether to merge that new feature back to master.
	- using too many branches might cause complication (so be aware I guess?). 
	- Sticking to a linear master approach (without branches) is easy. Good for incremental changes (rather than big experimental stuff.)

Extra notes...

	Previously when I submit the command..
	
		git commit

	It kept giving me the error message... error: There was a problem with the editor.... Please supply the message using either -m or -F option.

	These forums has some useful info
